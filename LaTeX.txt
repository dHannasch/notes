 I can no longer access configuration options in Kile from Settings->Configure kile
 In fact, "Settings" menu has only five entries: "Define current document as master document", "System check", "Show side bar", "Show message bar", and "Toolbars shown."
 Try removing the user specific file for Kile. I had the same problem after I messed with the toolbars.
~$ rm ~/.kde/share/apps/kile/kileui.rc
These guys had the had the same problem. They suggest the folder ~/.kde4 where on my system 12.10 (64) it was in ~/.kde.

 Until today, when I compiled the document using PDFLaTeX from within Kile everything worked fine. Now, however, it no longer automatically runs bibtex, even though the option "automatically run additional tools" under "Configure Kile -> Tools -> Build -> PDFLaTeX" is checked.
 Even if I configure the QuickBuild option to run PDFLaTeX BiBTeX no bbl file is created.
However, if I directly run the BibTeX tool from the drop-down menu or with Alt+-, it works.



BibTeX regenerates the .bbl file from the .bib file based on the date of the .aux file, not the date of the .bib file; I don't make the rules
 so if you change the .bib file but not the .tex file, BibTeX will not regenerate the .bbl
1. Make changes to .bib file.
2. Run LaTeX (updates .aux file)
3. Run BibTeX (updates .bbl file)
4. Run LaTeX (updates .aux file)
5. Run LaTeX (updates .dvi or .pdf file)
