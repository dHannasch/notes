This would be a good conference to explore submitting to, particularly
about meta-research problems.  Additionally, because it's at JHU,
there would be opportunities to meet with folks at STSci and JHU about
projects.

I think that the interactive data visualization / vr would fit, as
would bitmap indexing, and the open data releases and the hub.

eScience Community,

Deadline for the IEEE eScience 2016 conference in Baltimore Maryland
are approaching fast --- abstract are due Monday May 16, and full
papers due one week later on May 23!

Submit your abstracts here:
https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ESCIENCE2016

We welcome submissions in cyberinfrastructure in support of science,
systems and methods for data-intensive science, case studies in new
discoveries enabled by eScience techniques and technologies, and
scientometrics -- bibliometrics, reproducibility studies,
sustainability studies, and more.

More information on the conference website:

The conference is October 23 through 27 -- we hope to see you there!!

Bill Howe and Martin Kersten, Program Chairs
Alex Szalay and Randal Burns, General Chairs

From the call:

eScience continues to have a transformative impact across all fields.
New discoveries are increasingly driven by the techniques and
technologies of advanced computing, and eScience is the only community
that brings together researchers, practitioners, sponsors, and users,
across all disciplines and at all scales, to share ideas about how to
design, deliver, and use these approaches. The eScience 2016
conference will serve as the premier forum to present the latest
research in systems, applications, and products from the international
and interdisciplinary eScience community.

A special emphasis for the 2016 conference is data-intensive science,
scientific data management, and data science. In recent years,
data-intensive science has taken center stage, and for good reason: in
all fields, and at all scales, the bottleneck of discovery has shifted
from data acquisition to data analysis, and the software and systems
designed to extract knowledge from large, noisy, heterogeneous
datasets are having transformative impact. In addition to the core
topics of the eScience community, we encourage papers on systems,
methods, and infrastructure supporting the integration, management,
analysis, and visualization of complex datasets in one or more
scientific fields.

Major topics include but are not limited to:

Data-Intensive Science:

Scientific Databases
Open Science and Open Data
Sharing Sensitive Data and Data Privacy
Collaborative Data Analysis
Visualization and Visual Analytics
Citizen Science

Cyberinfrastucture for Science:

Cloud computing platforms and applications
High-performance computing platforms and applications
Scalable Dataflow platforms and applications
Complexity-hiding middleware
Application deployment and integration

Progress in major theme areas, e.g.:

Precision Medicine, Translational Health Research
Climate, Environmental, and Earth Science
Civic Tech, Urban Data Science, Smart and Connected Communities
Social Media Analytics
Computational Social Science
Digital Humanities
Education Analytics
Engineering

Scientometrics:

Scholarly Big Data and Large-Scale Bibliometrics
Altmetrics and Scholarly Impact
Reproducibility Studies
Scientific Demographics
Sustainability, Costs, and Funding
