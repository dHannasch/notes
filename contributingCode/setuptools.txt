setuptools source code is at https://github.com/pypa/setuptools
setuptools.extension.Extension is a thin wrapper around distutils.extension.Extension (just adding the Cython part),
yet distutils source code is harder to find, but is at https://bitbucket.org/carljm/python-distutils/

class Extension:
    """Just a collection of attributes that describes an extension
    module and everything needed to build it (hopefully in a portable
    way, but there are hooks that let you be as unportable as you need).

    Instance attributes:
      name : string
        the full name of the extension, including any packages -- ie.
        *not* a filename or pathname, but Python dotted name
      sources : [string]
        list of source filenames, relative to the distribution root
        (where the setup script lives), in Unix form (slash-separated)
        for portability.  Source files may be C, C++, SWIG (.i),
        platform-specific resource files, or whatever else is recognized
        by the "build_ext" command as source for a Python extension.
      include_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ header files (in Unix
        form for portability)
      define_macros : [(name : string, value : string|None)]
        list of macros to define; each macro is defined using a 2-tuple,
        where 'value' is either the string to define it to or None to
        define it without a particular value (equivalent of "#define
        FOO" in source or -DFOO on Unix C compiler command line)
      undef_macros : [string]
        list of macros to undefine explicitly
      library_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at link time
      libraries : [string]
        list of library names (not filenames or paths) to link against
      runtime_library_dirs : [string]
        list of directories to search for C/C++ libraries at run time
        (for shared extensions, this is when the extension is loaded)
      extra_objects : [string]
        list of extra files to link with (eg. object files not implied
        by 'sources', static library that must be explicitly specified,
        binary resource files, etc.)
      extra_compile_args : [string]
        any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use
        when compiling the source files in 'sources'.  For platforms and
        compilers where "command line" makes sense, this is typically a
        list of command-line arguments, but for other platforms it could
        be anything.
      extra_link_args : [string]
        any extra platform- and compiler-specific information to use
        when linking object files together to create the extension (or
        to create a new static Python interpreter).  Similar
        interpretation as for 'extra_compile_args'.
      export_symbols : [string]
        list of symbols to be exported from a shared extension.  Not
        used on all platforms, and not generally necessary for Python
        extensions, which typically export exactly one symbol: "init" +
        extension_name.
      swig_opts : [string]
        any extra options to pass to SWIG if a source file has the .i
        extension.
      depends : [string]
        list of files that the extension depends on
      language : string
        extension language (i.e. "c", "c++", "objc"). Will be detected
        from the source extensions if not provided.
      optional : boolean
        specifies that a build failure in the extension should not abort the
        build process, but simply not install the failing extension.

setuptools.setup is literally distutils.core.setup. Seriously, if you look at setuptools.__init__.py, you'll see setup = distutils.core.setup.
All arguments to distutils.core.setup are passed along to distutils.dist.Distribution (unless you specify a different distclass). So adding a random option like more_ext_modules results in anaconda3/envs/python2env/lib/python2.7/distutils/dist.py:267: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'more_ext_modules'
distutils.dist.Distribution.__init__(self, attrs) does for (key, val) in attrs.items(): if hasattr(self, key): setattr(self, key, val), which would include ext_modules
